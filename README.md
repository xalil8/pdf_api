Sometime when i read papers and pdf , i want to read them later or save it to read later but they lost sometimes.
I want to keep them in a folder in my google drive to acces anytime with any device.
So I create that simple python app with PyQt6
Basicall take pdf link and name that want to save then save it in desired folder in google drive.
In this projec i used Google cloud , pydrive and Pyqt6
